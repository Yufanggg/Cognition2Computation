## Overview
This repository contains the ETL (Extract, Transform and load) data into a SQL database SQL queries and the slide presentation for the analytical project on COVID-19 pandemic for the US Analysis

This project aims at exploring the answers to the following questions:
1. How have the positive and negative COVID-19 cases trended over time? Are there any noticeable spikes or drops in the number of positive or negative cases?
2. How have the numbers of currently hospitalized and ICU patients changed over time? What are the trends in cumulative hospitalizations and ICU admissions?
